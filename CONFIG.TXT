; Alarm settings

; WARNING: GPS measurements depend on very weak signals
;          received from orbiting satellites. As such, they
;          are prone to interference, and should NEVER be
;          relied upon for life saving purposes.

;          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THESE ALARMS BE
;          USED TO INDICATE DEPLOYMENT OR BREAKOFF ALTITUDE.

; NOTE:    Alarm elevations are given in meters above ground
;          elevation, which is specified in DZ_Elev.

Win_Above:    20 ; Window above each alarm (m)
Win_Below:    20 ; Window below each alarm (m)
DZ_Elev:     418 ; Ground elevation (m above sea level) - Skydive Pennsylvania
;DZ_Elev:     472 ; Ground elevation (m above sea level) - Sawtooth
;DZ_Elev:     24 ; Ground elevation (m above sea level) - Skydive Deland
