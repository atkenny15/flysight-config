; Alarm settings

; WARNING: GPS measurements depend on very weak signals
;          received from orbiting satellites. As such, they
;          are prone to interference, and should NEVER be
;          relied upon for life saving purposes.

;          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THESE ALARMS BE
;          USED TO INDICATE DEPLOYMENT OR BREAKOFF ALTITUDE.

; NOTE:    Alarm elevations are given in meters above ground
;          elevation, which is specified in DZ_Elev.

Alarm_Elev: 3400 ; Alarm elevation (m above ground level)

; Silence windows

; NOTE:    Silence windows are given in meters above ground
;          elevation, which is specified in DZ_Elev. Tones
;          will be silenced during these windows and only
;          alarms will be audible.
